Description
-----------
This script is used while in the [Grimoire](http://www.bungie.net/en/Grimoire/) section of your account.


Purpose
-------
Running the script will check all of your cards, compare them to the list of hard-coded Ghost Fragment card names, and give you a list of the ones missing.

Each entry in the list is clickable and will take you to the specific point in a YouTube video that pertains to that card.


How
---
There are two ways to run this code. Both of which require that you are logged in and on the Grimoire page first.

1. Copy the code in [grimoire.js](grimoire.js) and paste it into your Dev Tools console and hit enter. The code will fire automatically.
2. There's a bookmarklet version that you can copy into your bookmarks that when clicked, fires the code.
